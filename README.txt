EGG CHECKER THING

egg_classifier.h5 is needed for working the model (it is the model)
It cannot be deleted

data directory needs to exist as it is here

main.py is the streamlit code, run it and it will give the localhost link 
that localhost link will have to be run in the terminal for the streamlit application

install all the modules with:
pip install -r requirements.txt 

Anything else, just ask ig

this thing seems like it doesn't work but it does work, even though it may not seem so sometimes
